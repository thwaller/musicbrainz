Tools to assist Musicbrainz users.

This set of tools is a a work in progress. As I have time I will continue to add and make improvement, with the next addition being the iTunes Artwork Finder, which should also include the iTunes artist, release and recording search. Those are the two tools in my initial plan, but would like to add more.

This section is currently only hosted in GitHub Pages, which only supports static pages which publishes only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Should there be a need for further functionality, I will move it to a VM.
