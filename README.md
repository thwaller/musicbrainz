# Tools to assist Musicbrainz users.

This set of tools is a a work in progress. Initial version 1.0 is released and as far as I can see, is fully functional relative to what is on the site. Suggestions for new features, improvements or other changes are welcome.

## Hosted on GitHub Pages - https://thwaller.com/musicbrainz/

Notes:

1. GitHub Pages does not support `.htaccess` files.
2. The use of PHP in the iTunes Artwork Finder requires a third party PHP host as GitHub Pages does not support PHP.

## Credits

- The iTunes Artwork Finder utilizes code from Ben Dodson's [iTunes Artwork Finder](https://github.com/bendodson/itunes-artwork-finder).
- The EAC/XLD TOC Submitter utilizes code from Konstantin Mochalov's [lookup_eac_log](https://gist.github.com/kolen/766668).
